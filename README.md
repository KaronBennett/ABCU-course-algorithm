# ABCU-course-algorithm
This project was during my DSA: Analysis and Design class. Our job was to create an algorithm that allowed students to search for courses as well as print out all available courses in alphanumerical order.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects, the main problem I was solving was creating a program that could read course data from a file and organize it in a way that made it easy to search, sort, and display. The program needed to let users look up a specific course, see its title and prerequisites, and print all courses in alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, starting with how the data would be stored once it was read from the file. I used a vector to store the course objects and a hash table to quickly find courses by their course number. Understanding data structures was important because they helped the program run more efficiently and made it easier to manage relationships between courses and their prerequisites.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Some roadblocks I faced were file-loading and compiler errors. To overcome these problems, I tested one part of the program at a time and reviewed error messages carefully. I used Stack Overflow to help with my debugging.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project helped me understand the importance of planning before writing code. Writing pseudocode and choosing the right data structures first made the coding process smoother. I also learned how separating logic into functions makes programs easier to understand and update if requirements change.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project improved the way I write programs since I paid more attention to naming variables clearly, using consistent formatting, and keeping functions focused on one task. These changes made my code easier to read and debug, and they will help me write programs that are easier to maintain and adapt in future projects.
